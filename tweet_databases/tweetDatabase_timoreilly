[timoreilly][@debojitm Because we bought into the idea that productivity benefits belong to shareholders. see  #futureofwork]

[timoreilly][@CouchRambo @erikbryn was it you or @amcafee who said the people will rise up before the machines do at breakfast #futureofwork]
[timoreilly][@wildnfree1 @erikbryn Making stuff cheaper is part of the answer, but as long as the financial system works the way it does #futureofwork]
[timoreilly][@janicemccallum Age bias a real problem, as is any kind of bias. Part of the answer is teaching everyone to make their own job #futureofwork]
[timoreilly][Q5 How can participants enter @mitides Inclusive Innovation Competition #FutureofWork @MITIIC]
[timoreilly][RT @mitsloanexperts We can either harness #technology as a job creator, or allow it to become a job destroyer.  John Irons, @Rockefelle]
[timoreilly][@mitsloanexperts @RockefellerFdn I love that quote]
[timoreilly][Also check out some of what Ive written about what I call the #WTFEconomy and the #NextEconomy we want to build at ]
[timoreilly][@robertdolci @erikbryn In the end, the #NextEconomy will be a creative economy. Coding is only one way of being creative #futureofwork]
[timoreilly][@robertdolci But in the end, coding will change beyond description by the time those kids grow up. Need a learning mindset #futureofwork]
[timoreilly][Check out @erikbryns #TEDtalk about the second machine age  #FutureofWork]
[timoreilly][@robertdolci Im not sure learning to code is the right answer even now. Sure, reading, writing, arithmetic, coding #futureofwork]
[timoreilly][@jerrymichalski Theres lots of work that needs doing, weve just convinced ourselves that profit more important #futureofwork]
[timoreilly][@jerrymichalski or 2 Move to a heavier taxeffective social redistribution system, of which UBI will be one component #futureofwork]
[timoreilly][@jerrymichalski We have a choice 1 remember that workers are also customers, and employ them rather than obsolete them #futureofwork]

[timoreilly][@erikbrynBureaucracy need not be a hindrance. We just need to bring it into the 21st century. Thats what @codeforamerica does #futureofwork]

[timoreilly][@robertdolci Do you know him Would love an intro if so.]
[timoreilly][@erikbryn @OddsLot The key is for gov to provide funding for more DIYhandon education and not just traditional institutions #futureofwork]
[timoreilly][@erikbryn @OddsLot @oreillymedia There is a lot of govt money spent on workforce training, but much is poorly spent. #futureofwork]
[timoreilly][#futureofwork @OddsLot Whether its books, conferences, or @safari, @oreillymedia learners are selfmotivated, but often their companies pay]
[timoreilly][@erikbryn @OddsLot 12 In the end @oreillymedia is a learning business, and we see both individuals and companies paying #futureofwork]
[timoreilly][Q3 What are some new and improved opportunities created thus far from inclusive innovation #FutureofWork]
[timoreilly][Charles Handy nailed the #futureofwork 25 years ago But thats what I call the #WTFEconomy, not the #NextEconomy ]
[timoreilly][Nice @MITIIC celebrates organizations that create a more inclusive amp sustainable future for all  #FutureofWork]

[timoreilly][@robertdolci @erikbryn Yes, but one key question will be who the bots work for #futureofwork]
[timoreilly][@robertdolci @erikbryn Yes. And there are huge opportunities for what Ive called algorithmic regulation  see ]
[timoreilly][Q2 How do we get companies to think about creating great experiences for workers, not just great experiences for customers #FutureOfWork]

[timoreilly][@HumansCanLearn I agree  but education alone cant fix the jobs problem. We need to change the incentives for companies. #futureofwork]
[timoreilly][@erikbryn Yes, but given how much executive compensation is in stock, that forces most towards shorttermism, no #futureofwork]
[timoreilly][@erikbryn It seems to me that financialization is a big part of the problem  see  #futureofwork]
[timoreilly][@erikbryn What do you think about the incentives in our financial system to treat workers as a cost rather than an asset #futureofwork]
[timoreilly][@janicemccallum @erikbryn Yes, many knowledge workers will see their jobs threatened #futureofwork]
[timoreilly][@erikbryn @jasonvwells Totally agree. Also education on demand, and for a lifetime #futureofwork]
[timoreilly][Q1 What do you mean by inclusive innovation Can you offer examples of companies that have or are actively engaged in this #FutureofWork]
[timoreilly][@OddsLot @erikbryn Some jobs will disappear completely, and quickly, while new jobs will explode on the sceneothers taper off #futureofwork]
