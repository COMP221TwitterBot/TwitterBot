[@SarahPalinUSA][Most things Obama talked about are handled better on the individual, local amp state level. Growing our bankrupt fed govt is NOT the answer.]

[@SarahPalinUSA][RT @NRAILA Obamas commonsense reform requires gun registration and confiscation #SOTU ]
[@SarahPalinUSA][Now were going to eradicate poverty around the world. But remember this wont increase our deficit by a single dime #sotUGottaBKiddingMe]
[@SarahPalinUSA][By the way, women working at the White House make less than men. Clean your own house first, Mr. President. #sotUGottaBKiddingMe]
[@SarahPalinUSA][Real median household income has declined 4,520 since Obama took office. #sotUGottaBKiddingMe #ObamaHurtsTheMiddleClass]
[@SarahPalinUSA][The annual cost per household from federal regulations is over 15,000. #sotUGottaBKiddingMe]
[@SarahPalinUSA][Just 14 of Americas seniors believe they can retire comfortably. #sotUGottaBKiddingMe]

[@SarahPalinUSA][Balanced approach means Im going to increase your taxes to pay for my crony capitalism. #NoOneIsBuyingThis #sotUGottaBKiddingMe]
[@SarahPalinUSA][Keep in mind that the sequester was Obamas baby. He signed it into law. Now he thinks its economic Armageddon. #sotUGottaBKiddingMe]
[@SarahPalinUSA][We have 46 trillion in fed spending from Obamas FY13 Budget through 2022. Thats not responsible or balanced #sotUGottaBKiddingMe]
[@SarahPalinUSA][5.9 million was added to the national debt since Obama took office. #sotUGottaBKiddingMe]
