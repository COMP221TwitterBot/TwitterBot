[timoreilly][Q5 How can participants enter mitides Inclusive Innovation Competition FutureofWork MITIIC]
[timoreilly][RT mitsloanexperts We can either harness technology as a job creator, or allow it to become a job destroyer.  John Irons, Rockefelle]
[timoreilly][mitsloanexperts RockefellerFdn I love that quote]
[timoreilly][Also check out some of what Ive written about what I call the WTFEconomy and the NextEconomy we want to build at ]
[timoreilly][robertdolci erikbryn In the end, the NextEconomy will be a creative economy. Coding is only one way of being creative futureofwork]
[timoreilly][robertdolci But in the end, coding will change beyond description by the time those kids grow up. Need a learning mindset futureofwork]
[timoreilly][Check out erikbryns TEDtalk about the second machine age  FutureofWork]
[timoreilly][robertdolci Im not sure learning to code is the right answer even now. Sure, reading, writing, arithmetic, coding futureofwork]

[timoreilly][.MITIIC raises awareness and celebrates those who use innovation to improve the lives of workers  FutureofWork]
[timoreilly][robertdolci Do you know him Would love an intro if so.]
[timoreilly][erikbryn OddsLot The key is for gov to provide funding for more DIYhandon education and not just traditional institutions futureofwork]
[timoreilly][erikbryn OddsLot oreillymedia There is a lot of govt money spent on workforce training, but much is poorly spent. futureofwork]
[timoreilly][futureofwork OddsLot Whether its books, conferences, or safari, oreillymedia learners are selfmotivated, but often their companies pay]

[timoreilly][erikbryn Yes, but given how much executive compensation is in stock, that forces most towards shorttermism, no futureofwork]
[timoreilly][erikbryn It seems to me that financialization is a big part of the problem  see  futureofwork]
