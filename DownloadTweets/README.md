Team members: Ayoub Belemlih, Connor Boyle, Andrew Cui

Files:


* getTweets.py: Python code to generate files that contain tweets based on the input usernames. When the file is ran, a user or a list of users (separated by commas) can be entered. The program downloads public tweets from the username’s account and saves them in a file “"TweetDatabases/tweetDatabase_”.

* webScraping.py: Python code to retrieve usernames of the 100 most followed users on twitter. The function find_twitter_usernames() returns a string with the usernames separated by commas.
