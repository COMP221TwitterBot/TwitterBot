* nchains.py is the main function to create Markov Chains and generate tweets.
* run_sample.py provides a smooth sample run of the program. Note that this program has a lot in common with nchains.py, but this program has more user-friendly guidelines to run the program.
* graph.py is the class for a graph object used to build Markov Chain.
* tweet_databases is a folder containing scraped tweets organized by usernames.
* generateNetwork.py generates the formula to build the Mathematica network visualization (under the folder DownloadTweets).
